                january 2015 and i'm in the diamond lane going south on the 110. my partner is in the passenger seat.

                i've just spent a week showing her los angeles — the house i grew up in, the places i drove to escape it, the routes i took to dull the pain of losing one parent to cancer and another to grief.

                now it's time to say goodbye.

                we hit the judge harry pregerson interchange, where the 110 intersects the 105, and take the carpool ramp.

                its pylons lift us up and above the city, banking 15 degrees from south to west.

                los angeles pans out as if in cinemascope, windshield as the camera lens.

                when i was growing up, my mom commuted three or four days a week to irvine, where she taught critical theory and film history.

                she took the 5 to and from orange county, and i internalized its landmarks in relation to their ETA.

                john wayne airport meant she was just leaving work, disneyland meant an hour away, the citadel outlet mall meant 45 minutes, get the table set for dinner.

                i listened to *the suburbs* for the first time while tracing her commute, on the way to an angels game in anaheim.

                isaac and i were in the diamond lane on the 5, zipping past congestion in norwalk.

                it was summer 2010, and for the first time i opened up about the flood of blue that colored every day.

                in 2010 and 2011, i drove *the suburbs* endlessly.

                when i was most frozen by grief, it was the only way i could thaw into tears.

                it made me feel like a character, a protagonist in my own story shot through the windshield.

                "...While writing this book, the freeways that encircle and bisect Los Angeles were under constant construction; the topography of the road reconfigured itself daily. As the new 'Century Freeway' loomed apocalyptically into the future, one could not help but draw parallels between the end of this century and the end of the last."

                the 105, finished in october 1993, five months after i was born, is technically named the glenn anderson freeway, for a democratic representative from san pedro who advocated for the freeway's construction and who died shortly after its completion.

                or the el segundo freeway, for its western terminus. or the norwalk freweay, for its eastern edge.

                more commonly, it's called the century freeway, a name pregnant with modernism, expansion, progress.

                when the century freeway opened, the los angeles freeway system was declared complete.

                the route, drafted at the peak of the 20th century, was finished exactly at the moment frederic jameson put language to the transition between modernism and its post–.

                its construction displaced over 25,000 people and demolished the childhood homes of both the beach boys and the carpenters.

                in *speed*, the 1994 keanu reeves vehicle, a bus cannot go any slower than 50 miles per hour or it will explode.

                it was filmed during the century freeway's construction and ushers in the third by having the bus jump a gap between unfinished sections of suspended highway.

                read a certain way, *speed* takes up the transit politics of los angeles, public transit imperiled by highway construction. 

                its climax, in the tunnels for the metro red line, the bus finally comes to a halt.

                but los angeles depends on the vehicle as a mode of sectatorship.

                each drive is a narrative, each freeway named for a peripheral character.

                it's how i learned to fashion myself into a protagonist, the leading character in my own story.

                it's how i learned to structure time.

                i drop my partner off at LAX and drive home, eastward, sun setting both in the rearview mirror and in reflection across the library tower.

                i rinse the windshield and turn the wipers on. i'm too shut off to cry.

                i merge to the right lane, take the directional ramp from I-105 EB to I-110 NB, and wind my way north towards a reconfigured feeling of home.

                we were flying down the 105 when the traffic set in
                the freeway, like a printed circuit, brought us to the end
                through the windshield it was tail lights forever
                i told you i didn't know if we'd make your flight
                stuck in the diamond lane against the sunset we waited

                if i didn't want you to leave why did i try so hard to make it seem that way
                i didn't know how to ask you to stay

                i'm driving east now
                the sun has gone down, but the light's still hanging on
                in every building tall enough to reflect it
                i take my exit and wind up through the foothills
                alone

                if i didn't want you to leave why did i lie so often to say i'm okay
                i didn't know how to ask you to stay
