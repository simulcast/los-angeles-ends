                january 2015 and i'm in the diamond lane going south on the 110. my partner is in the passenger seat.

                i've just spent a week showing her los angeles — my childhood home, my teenage rhythms, the contours of new abandonment fears as my dad and i grieve the same loss in divergent ways.

                now it's time to say goodbye.

                we soar along the harbor corridor, high velocity and light traffic.

                at the judge harry pregerson interchange, where the 110 intersects the 105, we take the carpool ramp.

                its pylons lift us above the city, banking 15 degrees from south to west.

                it feels as if there's barely any force at all preventing us from taking off, launching, driving up up up into the stratosphere.

                the vista pans out like cinema, windshield as our camera lens.

                we land, softly, onto the 105.

                traffic hits, and as we slow to a stop i rinse the windshield and turn the wipers on.

                i'm too shut off to cry.

                in *speed*, the 1994 keanu reeves vehicle, a bus cannot go any slower than 50 miles per hour or it will explode.

                it was filmed during the century freeway's construction and climaxes with the bus jumping a gap between unfinished sections of suspended highway.

                every time i take the HOV ramp i recite this anecdote. on one recent trip, i turned to wikipedia for the full story and found myself confronting a false memory —

                "The highway section the bus jumped over is the directional ramp from I-105 WB to I-110 NB (not the HOV ramp from I-110 SB to I-105 WB as commonly believed.)"

                every time i returned to los angeles, i used the freeway as an anesthetic.

                the house felt uninhabitable, but i could always fight loneliness with a destination.

                i made lists of restaurants that jonathan gold had written up, of places where i could find remnants of the red car system, of spots like aroma driving range, in koreatown, where i hit golf balls onto a netting above the parking garage.

                i fell head over heels for the city.

                "Mere driving on the freeway is in no way the same as participating in it. Anyone can 'drive' on the freeway, and many people with no vocation for it do, hesitating here and resisting there, losing the rhythm of the lane change, thinking about where they came from and where they are going..."

                joan didion once described the freeway system as "the only secular communion los angeles has."

                she followed that line with an essay-length indictment of caltrans as it installed carpool lanes across the city.

                sometimes i wonder if she was simply lamenting the fact that it encouraged everyone to have a passenger, to no longer drive alone.

                "...Actual participants think only about where they are. Actual participation requires a total surrender, a concentration so intense as to seem a kind of narcosis, a rapture-of-the-freeway. The mind goes clean. The rhythm takes over. A distortion of time occurs, the same distortion that characterizes the instant before an accident."

                i drive home, eastward, sun setting both in the rearview mirror and in reflection across the library tower. 

                i merge to the right lane, take the directional ramp from I-105 EB to I-110 NB, and wind my way through a shifting feeling of home.

                we were flying down the 105 when the traffic set in
                the freeway, like a printed circuit, brought us to the end
                through the windshield it was tail lights forever
                i told you i didn't know if we'd make your flight
                stuck in the diamond lane against the sunset we waited

                if i didn't want you to leave why did i try so hard to make it seem that way
                i didn't know how to ask you to stay

                i'm driving east now
                the sun has gone down, but the light's still hanging on
                in every building tall enough to reflect it
                i take my exit and wind up through the foothills
                alone

                if i didn't want you to leave why did i lie so often to say i'm okay
                i didn't know how to ask you to stay
