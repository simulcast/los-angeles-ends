                january 2015 and i'm in the diamond lane going south on the 110. my partner is in the passenger seat.

                i've just spent a week showing her los angeles — the house i grew up in, the places i drove to escape it, the routes i took to dull the pain of losing one parent to cancer and another to grief.

                now it's time to say goodbye.

                we hit the judge harry pregerson interchange, where the 110 intersects the 105, and take the carpool ramp.

                its pylons lift us up and above the city, banking 15 degrees from south to west.

                los angeles pans out as if in cinemascope, windshield as the camera lens.

                when i was growing up, my mom commuted three or four days a week to irvine, where she taught critical theory and visual studies.

                she took the 5 to and from orange county, a drive that framed her first book, *window shopping*. i internalized its landmarks in relation to her ETA.

                john wayne airport meant she was just leaving work, disneyland meant an hour away, the citadel outlet mall meant 45 minutes, get the table set for dinner.

                i listened to *the suburbs* for the first time while tracing the same commute.

                isaac and i were in the diamond lane on the 5, on the way to an angels game in anaheim, zipping past congestion in norwalk.

                it was summer 2010, the first time i tried to put words to the pain that i was certain no peer could understand.

                in 2010 and 2011, i drove *the suburbs* endlessly, [mapping myself into the songs](http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/).

                when i was most frozen by grief, it was the only way i could thaw into tears.

                it made me feel like a character, a protagonist in my own story shot through the windshield.

                "...While writing this book, the freeways that encircle and bisect Los Angeles were under constant construction; the topography of the road reconfigured itself daily. As the new 'Century Freeway' loomed apocalyptically into the future, one could not help but draw parallels between the end of this century and the end of the last."

                the 105, finished in october 1993, five months after i was born, is technically named the glenn anderson freeway, for a democratic representative from san pedro who died shortly after its completion.

                most often, it's called the century freeway, a name pregnant with modernism, expansion, progress.

                when it finally opened, the los angeles freeway system was declared complete.

                drafted at the peak of the 20th century, the 105 was finished during the same cultural moment in which frederic jameson published *postmodernism, or, the cultural logic of late capitalism*.

                in it, he argues that the built environments of los angeles and orange county facilitate new modes of viewing that break from 20th century tradition.

                from disneyland to the [bonaventure hotel](https://vimeo.com/140975476), these spaces mirror a new mutation in capitalism — a celebration of collapsed time and space.

                construction of the 105 displaced over 25,000 people.

                it also demolished the childhood homes of both brian wilson and karen carpenter.

                in *speed*, the 1994 keanu reeves vehicle, a bus cannot go any slower than 50 miles per hour or it will explode.

                it was filmed during the century freeway's construction and ushers in the third act by having the bus jump a gap between unfinished sections of the judge harry pregerson interchange.

                read a certain way, *speed* is a movie about the act of traversing los angeles, where each drive is a narrative arc and each freeway named for a peripheral character.

                it's shot like a police chase, with cinematography alarmingly similar to the aerial coverage of o.j. simpson's ford bronco driving the 5 up from orange county to brentwood.

                the shots are deeply familiar to me, born to a century where the jump cut between the view through the windshield and the view from above reads like natural language.

                i drop my partner off at LAX and drive home, eastward, sun setting both in the rearview mirror and in reflection across the library tower.

                forbidden from the diamond lane, i rinse the windshield and turn the wipers on. i'm too shut off to cry.

                the camera pans out and i see myself take the directional ramp from I-105 EB to I-110 NB, winding my way towards a constantly rearranged feeling of home.

                we were flying down the 105 when the traffic set in
                the freeway, like a printed circuit, brought us to the end
                through the windshield it was tail lights forever
                i told you i didn't know if we'd make your flight
                stuck in the diamond lane against the sunset we waited

                if i didn't want you to leave why did i try so hard to make it seem that way
                i didn't know how to ask you to stay

                i'm driving east now
                the sun has gone down, but the light's still hanging on
                in every building tall enough to reflect it
                i take my exit and wind up through the foothills
                alone

                if i didn't want you to leave why did i lie so often to say i'm okay
                i didn't know how to ask you to stay
