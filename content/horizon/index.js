                "someone's there and then they're not. it's not for singing about, it's not for making into art."

                on *a crow looked at me*, released in march 2017, elverum writes about his wife, genevieve castree, passing away of cancer.

                her death was sudden — violent and destructive with little regard for processing the end.

                the record unfurls like a real-time document of elverum's grief, in oscillation between stoic acceptance and pained refusal.

                it contains both a resignation that "death is real" and a refusal of fate  — "i reject nature. i disagree."

                the oscillation, like grief itself, generates a single tone.

                Across a distance, refuge in the dust
                All my life I can remember longing
                Looking across the water and seeing lights
                When I was five or six, we were camping in the islands in July
                The tall yellow grass and the rose hips fragrant
                After sunset, island beyond island
                Undulating and familiar, not far from home
                With my fragrant, whittled, cedared drift wood dagger in the mildew canvas tent
                I saw fireworks many miles away but didn't hear them...*

                Reaching for an idea of somewhere other than this place
                That could fold me in clouded yearning
                For nowhere actually reachable, the distance was the point*

                after death, the horizon becomes a fantasy.

                it feels like longing because you think that if you can get from where you are to the horizon — as far away as you can see, as far away as you can perceive — that maybe you can reach the person you've lost.

                maybe you can bring them back.

                i grew up in beachwood canyon, nesteld into the eastern edge of the santa monica mountains, in a house with wide glass panes that looked out over los angeles.

                designed by john lautner, it enshrines the city's most tantilizing pop-noir fantasy: peering out at the city from behind the glass one moment, being flung, violently, through the window and off a cliffside in the next.

                death, literally, is a flight trajectory towards the horizon line.

                from this point of view, my mom wrote [*the virtual window*](http://vectors.usc.edu/issues/4/virtualwindow/index.php), a book-length cultural history of window and frame — from renaissance perspective to the screens we read on now.

                windows, she argued, both present us the world and fundamentally alter the way we engage with it.

                the virtual, for her, was about presentations that were *almost* real, but *not quite*.

                eight years later, in college, i published an [essay](http://www.theindy.org) processing my mom's death by reading her book together with two arcade fire records she didn't live to hear — *the suburbs* and *reflektor.*

                i'd come to the conclusion that my mom's death, like metaphor, was virtual. *almost* real, but *not quite*.

                like the horizon, just-out-of-reach.

                in the conclusion to my mom's book, she writes about the death of french philosopher gilles deleuze, who threw himself from the window of his apartment.
                
                deleuze wrote frequently about the distinction between the space of the screen and the space outside of it — what he called the *hors-champ*, “a more radical elsewhere, outside homogenous space and time.”
                
                in his death, my mom ends, deleuze found a way to move out of the frame.

                the day after seeing the mount eerie show, i took my mom's lexus down the habor corridor. i wanted to drive into the horizon, to get just-out-of-reach, to break outside of the screen.

                i drove for an hour and ended up at sunken city, a stretch of san pedro that tumbled into the ocean in a 1929 landslide.

                got this feeling like i'm out of time
                plucked up and replaced by someone else altogether

                cast as my father in a mid-century home
                from behind the glass i watch the city play itself
                a screen and a window

                i keep dreaming of the horizon
                where the flatness ends
                and i'm not quite there yet

                [but the truth is i don't think of that dust as you
                you are the sunset]

                bummer driving in the dead of night
                when the light pollution blinds me from every star
                and so i wonder...

                if i take western as far south as it drives
                and wind up in the redcar ruins of san pedro
                do i pretend you're alive?

                i keep pointing towards the horizon
