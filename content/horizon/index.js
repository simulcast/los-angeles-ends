                phil elverum walks on stage, alone save for his acoustic guitar and a small potted plant.

                "death is real," he strums. "someone's there and then they're not. it's not for singing about, it's not for making into art."

Just as our room is now, so it will be in the world to come; where our baby sleeps now, there too it will sleep in the other world. And the clothes we wear in this world, those too we will wear there. Everything will be as it is now, just a little different."

                on *a crow looked at me*, the mount eerie record released in march 2017, phil elverum writes about his wife, [genevieve castree](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/bubble), dying of cancer.

                her death was sudden — violent and destructive with little regard for processing the end.

                their daughter was two.

                the record unfurls like a real-time document of elverum's grief, written and recorded in the fallout, in oscillation between acceptance and refusal.

                its songwriting devastates with specifics: the loneliness of taking out the garbage at night, the chill of proximity when the deceased show up in our dreams, the melancholy that sets in when looking out at the horizon.

                *a crow looked at me* validated feelings i'd written off as incomprehensible. it taught me how to grieve.

                Across a distance, refuge in the dust
                All my life I can remember longing
                Looking across the water and seeing lights...
                Reaching for an idea of somewhere other than this place
                That could fold me in clouded yearning
                For nowhere actually reachable, the distance was the point*

                after my mom died, the horizon line became a constant fantasy.

                there had to be another world on the other side, one that contained her.

                one just as it is now, but a little different.

                i grew up in beachwood canyon, nesteld into the eastern edge of the santa monica mountains, in a house with wide glass panes that looked out over los angeles.

                designed by john lautner, it enshrines the city's most tantilizing pop-noir fantasy: peering out at the city from behind the glass one moment, being flung, violently, through the window and off a cliffside in the next.

                death, literally, is a flight trajectory towards the horizon line.

                from this point of view, my mom wrote [*the virtual window*](http://vectors.usc.edu/issues/4/virtualwindow/index.php), a book-length cultural history of window and frame — from renaissance perspective to the screens we read on now.

                windows, she argued, both present us the world and fundamentally alter the way we engage with it.

                the virtual, for her, was about presentations that were *almost* real, but *not quite*.

                in college, i published [an essay](https://www.theindy.org/175) processing my mom's death by reading her book together with two arcade fire records she didn't live to hear — *the suburbs* and *reflektor.*

                i'd started to view my mom's death as virtual, through a window.

                *almost* real, but *not quite*. like the horizon, always just-out-of-reach.

                in the conclusion to *the virtual window*, my mom writes about the death of french philosopher gilles deleuze, who threw himself from the window of his apartment.

                deleuze wrote frequently about the distinction between the space of the screen and the space outside of it — what he called the *hors-champ*, “a more radical elsewhere, outside homogenous space and time.”

                in his death, my mom ends, deleuze found a way to move out of the frame.

                the day after seeing the mount eerie show, i took my mom's lexus down the habor corridor.

                i wanted to drive into the horizon, to get just-out-of-reach, to break outside of the screen.

                i drove for an hour and ended up at sunken city, a stretch of san pedro that tumbled into the ocean in a 1929 landslide.

                got this feeling like i'm out of time
                plucked up and replaced by someone else altogether
                and they know me better

                cast as my father in a mid-century home
                from behind the glass i watch the city play itself
                a screen and a window

                i keep dreaming of the horizon
                where the flatness ends
                and i'm not quite there yet

                if i take western as far south as it drives
                and wind up in the redcar ruins of san pedro
                do i pretend you're alive?
