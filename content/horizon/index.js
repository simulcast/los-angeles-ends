                got this feeling like i'm out of time
                plucked up and replaced by someone else altogether
                and they know me better

                cast as my father in a mid-century home
                from behind the glass i watch the city play itself
                a screen and a window

                i keep dreaming of the horizon
                where the flatness ends
                and i'm not quite there yet

                [slow pulsing red tower lights
                across a distance, refuge in the dust
                all my life i can remember longing
                looking across the water and seeing lights]

                bummer driving in the dead of night
                when the light pollution blinds me from every star
                and so i wonder...

                if i take western as far south as it drives
                and wind up in the redcar ruins of san pedro
                do i pretend you're alive?

                i keep pointing towards the horizon
                where the flatness ends
                and i'm not quite there yet
            `,
