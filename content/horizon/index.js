                born to the freeway and radio masts
                raised by my car and a black standard poodle
                crashed turning left, sunset and western
                i was trying to go home

                looked through the windshield, saw both of my parents
                grabbed my keys, got back in the car
                right hand scans the AM bands
                but this time i hit traffic
                and the radio went static

                car stalled, engine silent

                summer 2017 and i’m in town for my dad’s wedding.

                it’s the night before i return to providence, track this record, and pack up my things. i’ve decided to move back to LA.

                isaac and i are driving back from shatto lanes in my dad’s sedan. it’s 1am and we want tacos al pastor. we’re stopped at the red light going north on western, in the left turn lane waiting for the green. as the light on sunset turns from yellow to red, a car swerves through the intersection and smashes the driver-side door. they speed away, pushing off the side panel. we’re left frozen, turn signal blinking off the taco truck sign.

                the cops come, see my zankou t-shirt, and ask if i work there. they like the shawarma.

                right before [my mom](https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-anne-friedberg14-2009oct14-story.html) moved to los angeles, she was in a car crash too.

                she was on the way back from her father’s funeral and her mother stopped short. not wearing a seatbelt, she flew through the windshield.

                "So there I was in critical condition with a serious head injury until, as mysterious as it still seems, I returned from comatose near-death to what could only be described as near-life in LA. I was in post-traumatic shock, but also in a form of culture shock. Shards of glass kept coming out of my skin, rising to the surface like diamonds that couldn’t be digested by the flesh. There was too much sunshine, everything was too clean, colors were too bright. I kept trying to see Los Angeles as if it were Hollywood in black and white."

                "I recuperated at my partner’s family home, one of those capacious Hancock Park houses surrounded by palm trees but designed to look like a Tudor cottage in the Cotswolds. On the other side of the backyard hedge, I was told, was the house from Sunset Boulevard... The back hedge of the house in Sunset Boulevard was now a place where the dog barked at night as if he were calling across the lawns to ghosts that swam there thousands of nights before. Sunset Boulevard was just as far and just as close as it had ever been."

                i can only think about the deep symbolism of being stuck at the corner of sunset and western, the car crash my mom got on the edge of her move to los angeles, and the feelings of failure that crop up when you try to write yourself out of the narrative your parents had plotted for you.

                it's a printed circuit.
