                you called from mulholland as i was getting into bed
                already late i let the cell phone ring
                i retreated, said i didn't need it
                your love
                took shape
                in distance, affection, divided attention 
                uneven
                i received it, said i didn't need it

                almost right

                i called from a carphone as i split the cahuenga pass
                reception dropped before the phone could ring
                i needed help, didn't ask
                i'm sorry for that
                for the imbalance of that
                the distance between us, the static and signal
                uneven
                i retreated, said i didn't need it

                almost right
