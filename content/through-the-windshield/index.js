                as the light on sunset turns from yellow to red, a car swerves through the intersection and into the driver-side door.

                it speeds away, pushing off the side panel. i see only headlights.

                my turn signal blinks off leo's taco truck sign.

                "Two weeks before I moved to Los Angeles I was in a brutal automobile crash — a traumatic form of epistemological break. In a sudden mangle of glass and steel, I went through the windshield. It was as if I had to go through that glass in order to live in Los Angeles. Normally, the windshield acts as a corrective lens framing the world as it reels by and as a transparent protective skin that prevents us from entering the frame. Once I found myself on the other side, inside the frame, reality and fantasy slid into each other in a peculiarly confusing blur..."

                right before my mom moved to los angeles, she was in a car crash too.

                it was 1985, seven years before i was born.

                she was on the way back from her father’s *yahrzeit*, a jewish tradition honoring the one-year anniversary of a parent's death.

                her mother stopped the car short.

                not wearing a seatbelt, my mom flew through the windshield.

                it's been told to me by family and friends that, before this accident, my mom never have wanted to have children.

                i'm told, also, that she very nearly died there and then.

                each of the 24 years that followed were, for her, a bonus.

                "...I recuperated at my partner’s family home, one of those capacious Hancock Park houses surrounded by palm trees but designed to look like a Tudor cottage in the Cotswolds. On the other side of the backyard hedge, I was told, was the house from _Sunset Boulevard_... The back hedge of the house in _Sunset Boulevard_ was now a place where the dog barked at night as if he were calling across the lawns to ghosts that swam there thousands of nights before. _Sunset Boulevard_ was just as far and just as close as it had ever been."

                i try to accelerate, pull over. but the engine doesn't work and the steering shaft is jammed. we're immobile.

                the cops come, see my [zankou](https://www.lamag.com/longform/the-zankou-chicken-murders/) t-shirt, and ask if i work there. they like the shawarma.

                completed in 1904, sunset boulevard traces a 1780s cattle route along base of the santa monica mountains.

                it begins near the [zanja madre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3vKQNIsADQ), an aqueduct built by spanish colonizers to carry water from the los angeles river, and ends at the pacific ocean.

                it winds, sometimes violently, lined by palm trees and other non-native plants.

                originally called cahuenga road no. 2, in 1885 western avenue was re-named for a cardinal boundary of the city's development.

                it runs in a straight line, uninterrupted from los feliz boulevard in the hollywood hills to the pacific ocean in san pedro, the second-longest north-south street in the city.

                "First, there was Hollywood, the former village turned suburb turned part of Los Angeles — a specific place with geographic boundaries, constantly changing and contested. Then there was Hollywood as a generally accepted name for the homeland of the American movie industry... a shorthand for the stars and the films. Then, allied to that sense of phsyical place was yet another Hollywood, a more or less intangible place on earth or in the atmosphere above it, to which aspirants to fame could come and be recognized."

                like so many before me, i came to los angeles to play myself.

                but then there i was, stalled out at the corner of sunset boulevard and western avenue, cast in a reboot.

                and i couldn't even break the frame.

                born to the freeway and radio masts
                raised by my car and a black standard poodle
                crashed turning left, sunset and western
                i was trying to go home

                looked through the windshield, saw both of my parents
                grabbed my keys, got back in the car
                right hand scans the AM bands
                but this time i hit traffic
                and the radio went static

                car stalled, engine silent
