                born to the freeway and radio masts
                raised by my car and a black standard poodle
                crashed turning left, sunset and western
                i was trying to go home

                looked through the windshield, saw both of my parents
                grabbed my keys, got back in the car
                right hand scans the AM bands
                but this time i hit traffic
                and the radio went static
                
                car stalled, engine silent

                july 2017 and i’m in town for my dad’s wedding.

                it’s the night before i to return to providence, finish writing this record, and pack up my things.
                i had just decided to move back to LA.

                isaac and i are driving home from shatto lanes in my dad’s sedan. it’s 1am and we want tacos al pastor.
                we’re stopped at the red light going north on western, in the left turn lane waiting for green.

                as the light on sunset turns from yellow to red, a car swerves through the intersection and into the driver-side door.
                they speed away, pushing off the side panel. i see only headlights. my turn signal blinks off leo's taco truck sign.

                everything goes black.

                right before my mom moved to los angeles, she was in a car crash too. it was 1985, seven years before i was born.

                she was on the way back from her father’s funeral. her mother stopped the car short. not wearing a seatbelt, my mom flew through the windshield.

                it's been told to me by family and friends that, before this accident, my mom never have wanted to have children. i'm told, also, that she very nearly died there and then.

                i try to accelerate, pull over. but the engine doesn't work and the steering shaft is jammed. we're immobile.

                the cops come, see my zankou t-shirt, and ask if i work there. they like the shawarma.

                "So there I was in critical condition with a serious head injury until, as mysterious as it still seems, I returned from comatose near-death to what could only be described as near-life in LA. I was in post-traumatic shock, but also in a form of culture shock. Shards of glass kept coming out of my skin, rising to the surface like diamonds that couldn’t be digested by the flesh. There was too much sunshine, everything was too clean, colors were too bright. I kept trying to see Los Angeles as if it were Hollywood in black and white."

                "I recuperated at my partner’s family home, one of those capacious Hancock Park houses surrounded by palm trees but designed to look like a Tudor cottage in the Cotswolds. On the other side of the backyard hedge, I was told, was the house from _Sunset Boulevard_... The back hedge of the house in _Sunset Boulevard_ was now a place where the dog barked at night as if he were calling across the lawns to ghosts that swam there thousands of nights before. _Sunset Boulevard_ was just as far and just as close as it had ever been."

                like so many before me, i envisioned a new life in los angeles — one where i could play myself.

                but then there i was, stalled out at the corner of sunset boulevard and western avenue, an intersection stupidly loaded with the poetry of westward expansion, starring in a reboot.

                and i couldn't even break the frame.
