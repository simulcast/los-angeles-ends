                it’s the night before i to return to providence, start writing this record, and pack up my things.

                i've just decided to move back to LA.

                as the light on sunset turns from yellow to red, a car swerves through the intersection and into the driver-side door.

                they speed away, pushing off the side panel. i see only headlights.

                my turn signal blinks off leo's taco truck sign.

                "So there I was in critical condition with a serious head injury until, as mysterious as it still seems, I returned from comatose near-death to what could only be described as near-life in LA. I was in post-traumatic shock, but also in a form of culture shock. Shards of glass kept coming out of my skin, rising to the surface like diamonds that couldn’t be digested by the flesh. There was too much sunshine, everything was too clean, colors were too bright. I kept trying to see Los Angeles as if it were Hollywood in black and white..."

                right before my mom moved to los angeles, she was in a car crash too. it was 1985, seven years before i was born.

                on the way back from her father’s funeral, her mother stopped the car short. not wearing a seatbelt, my mom flew through the windshield.

                it's been told to me by family and friends that, before this accident, my mom never have wanted to have children. i'm told, also, that she very nearly died there and then.

                "...I recuperated at my partner’s family home, one of those capacious Hancock Park houses surrounded by palm trees but designed to look like a Tudor cottage in the Cotswolds. On the other side of the backyard hedge, I was told, was the house from _Sunset Boulevard_... The back hedge of the house in _Sunset Boulevard_ was now a place where the dog barked at night as if he were calling across the lawns to ghosts that swam there thousands of nights before. _Sunset Boulevard_ was just as far and just as close as it had ever been."

                i try to accelerate, pull over. but the engine doesn't work and the steering shaft is jammed. we're immobile.

                the cops come, see my [zankou](https://www.lamag.com/longform/the-zankou-chicken-murders/) t-shirt, and ask if i work there. they like the shawarma.

                completed in 1904, sunset boulevard traces a 1780s cattle route along base of the santa monica mountains.

                it begins near the [zanja madre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3vKQNIsADQ), an aqueduct built by spanish colonizers to carry water from the los angeles river, and ends at the pacific ocean.

                it winds, sometimes violently, lined by palm trees and other non-native plants.

                originally called cahuenga road no. 2, in 1885 western avenue was re-named for a cardinal boundary of the city's development.

                it runs in a straight line, uninterrupted from los feliz boulevard in the hollywood hills to the pacific ocean in san pedro, the second-longest north-south street in the city.

                "First, there was Hollywood, the former village turned suburb turned part of Los Angeles — a specific place with geographic boundaries, constantly changing and contested. Then there was Hollywood as a generally accepted name for the homeland of the American movie industry... a shorthand for the stars and the films. Then, allied to that sense of phsyical place was yet another Hollywood, a more or less intangible place on earth or in the atmosphere above it, to which aspiraants to fame could come and be recognized."

                like so many before me, i came to los angeles to play myself.

                but then there i was, stalled out at the corner of sunset boulevard and western avenue, cast in a reboot.

                and i couldn't even break the frame.

                born to the freeway and radio masts

                crashed turning left, sunset and western
                i was trying to go home

                looked through the windshield, saw both of my parents
                grabbed my keys, got back in the car
                right hand scans the AM bands
                but this time i hit traffic
                and the radio went static

                car stalled, engine silent
