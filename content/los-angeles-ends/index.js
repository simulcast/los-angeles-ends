                december 2016 i'm home for the holidays.

                the sun, set but still glowing over glendale, radiates off the hood of my car.

                a pulsating orange rips through the sky, indexing every time i’ve seen los angeles play the apocalypse’s backdrop.

                i think about childhood nightmares of nuclear bombs exploding on the horizon, of knowing the end is soon and near but not right now or quite yet here.

                i think about *miracle mile*, a movie that my parents showed me when i was too young to process death properly, where missiles come flying over the santa monica mountains and land in the la brea tar pits.

                i think about the episode of *24* where jack bauer cries as a mushroom cloud rises over valencia.

                my mom died in october 2009, while the [station fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCkRccwAr7Y) burned in the san gabriels, and ever since i've had nightmares of los angeles disappearing in a single orange blast.

                i'll be sitting atop elysian park, where i can see a third of the playing field at dodger stadium. i’ve taken a picnic and a transistor radio to hear vin scully call the game. i feel santa ana winds cut the air.

                then i turn my head and watch as the light grows closer, warmer, brighter.

                “i guess that’s it,” i think.

                i always wake up in a sweat.

                it's my fault — it wouldn’t have happened if i hadn’t looked.

                "I was driving east across Sunset. Here and there the familiar buildings of downtown – most prominently, the Library Tower – swung into view behind the hills and the haze. And then through left (“blue”) eye I saw downtown, all of it—  Disappear. As if it had never been.  Obliterated in a flash of light more intense than can be imagined or described. The canonical phrase only hints at what I (monocularly) saw. 'Brighter than a thousand suns...'"

                in 2015 my dad underwent surgery to correct his vision.

                it had split, temporarily, in two.

                afterwards, he wrote a short story in which one eye witnesses los angeles ending, sees downtown disappear in a single orange blast.

                it was impossible for us to reconcile two realities that each felt so true: one in which my mom was still alive, another in which she was irretrievably gone.

               when i wrote this song, depressed and grieving losses both personal and societal, i was fascinated with the world ending. i was excited, even, by the possibility.

               i fantasized about los angeles ending because i was ending.

               because loss makes the apocalypse feel like an appealing alternative to life.

                but as i write this it's 2018 and malibu and the west valley are on fire, uncontained.

                i drive the 134 as the woolsey fire burns, sun blaring orange through the haze – radiant, beautiful, terrifying.

                the exact shade that ends the city in my song, in my dreams, in my dad's left eye.

                there is nothing exciting about it at all.

                i feel instead a sorrow, deep and painful, ripping me from myself.

                i no longer want this.

            "It is hard for people who have not lived in Los Angeles to realize how radically the Santa Ana figures in the local imagination. The city burning is Los Angeles's deepest image of itself; Nathanael West perceived that, in *The Day of the Locust*; and at the time of the 1965 Watts riots what struck the imagination most indelibly were the fires. For days one could drive the Harbor Freeway and see the city on fire, just as we had always known it would be in the end."

                there's something instructive about coming so close to the end and deciding that it's not the way forward. that the world is ending but i am not.

                on the best days it feels obvious, on the worst it feels like a lie.

                not a fire, not an explosion, just a constant tear in two.

                a dream of falling daylight
                underneath the orange glow so familiar in los angeles
                as a cloud blooms on the horizon
                i hear baseball on the radio

                this is the light that will take us with it

                a warm breeze in from the desert
                with an exhale, i try to let go
                listen to vin tell me what the sky looks like
                as the pitch comes in at 3 - 0
