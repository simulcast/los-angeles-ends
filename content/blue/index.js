                octboer 2010 and i feel like i'm sinking. i stumble out of bed, wander into the living room.

                my mom is sitting down, sipping a cappuccino, word document open on her titanium powerbook g4. light floods the windows.

                i see an orange glow where the computer charger meets the chassis, floating clouds on the desktop background.

                she sees me, registers that something is wrong, and grabs her keys.

                "do you want to go for a drive?" she asks.

                we make it all the way down the stairs, out the front door, into the driveway.

                i was fifteen when my mom was diagnosed with cancer. it was the year i learned how to drive.

                i remember my first time behind the wheel, in a silver prius owned by melrose driving school, heading down western to 3rd street, across 3rd to la cienega, up la cienega to sunset, west on sunset to coldwater, then up coldwater to mulholland, tracing the line between the los angeles basin and the san fernando valley.

                i'm not sure that i said a single word.

                growing up in beachwood canyon, there was nowhere in the neighborhood to walk and only one bus that could take me into the city. it stopped ten minutes away, came every half hour, and took twenty minutes to get down the hill.

                driving was the only way out.

                i got my license from the glendale dmv in november 2009, a month after my mom died.

                i drove to valley parties, mostly, where a certain type of anhedonia could always be amplified.

                i was free, finally. i was also profoundly broken.

                i inherited my mom's car, a 2006 lexus rx400h with a gps named natacha — after anna karina's character in *alphaville*.

                what i wanted most was the long drive home, alone, blasting music.

                one night, after a valley party but before i slept on the floor in someone's guest room, my friends and i went up to the encino ave footbridge.

                a spiral staircase took us up above the 101, each passing car a blast of wind that buckled our knees.

                we  played frogger, darting back and forth to dodge the shadows of every car that passed below.

                i took the 101 home the next morning, and i distinctly recall the way the sunlight looked in the upper edges of my windshield, where a tint prevents light from catching the driver's eye.

                it was shot day for night like a melodrama, flooded with blue.

                as i was finishing this record, cleaning out my childhood bedroom, i found a note from a high school classmate.

                "somehow, being your passenger was the closest i'd gotten to achieving a deeper conversation with you," they wrote.

                i live back in los angeles now, habitually driving the san diego to the harbor, the harbor up to hollywood, the hollywood to the golden state.

                there's no destination, i'm just moving towards the vanishing point.

                been wondering about you
                and if you might be wondering that way too
                without you i'm shot day for night
                skylight shades the house in tungsten hues

                last time we spoke was in a dream
                you asked me if we could go for a drive
                "it's good to have you back," i said
                then i woke up, and tore through the east side

                a different point of view it can't be true
                carves me up in ways i can't undo
                if i were stronger i would
                split in two

                i feel an urgency so blue

                in that last year i learned to drive
                banished from the house to 101
                i sped through ice cold valley light
                and cried in horror in the drive-thru line

                8 years i wrote just one song
                thinking maybe i should give this up
                hop back on at lankershim

                a different point of view it can't be true
                carves me up in ways i can't undo
